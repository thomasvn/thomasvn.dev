#### Engineer 👨🏻‍💻, San Diego 📍

I love thinking, building, reading, and writing. I really enjoy some quality conversation, and I’m trying my best to do a little more good each day.

Currently interested in:
- cloud architecture + cloud security
- container security
- javascript
- philosophy of science
