### 👨🏻‍💻 Engineer, 📍 San Diego

Hey! Glad to have you here. My name’s Thomas, and I’m a software engineer based out of San Diego.

I really enjoy thinking, building, reading, and writing. Not too sure where I'm headed right now. But I'm just trying to learn a little more each day and do a little more good each day.

Currently interested in:

- container security
- kubernetes security
- 49ers football
- intro to philosophy
- surfing
