These are a few of the causes that I make monthly donations to.

I'd love for you to check out their websites, read their reports, and donate to their causes if you are able to at this time.
<br>
- Direct Relief -> Providing global disaster relief and sustainable solutions
<br>
- LifeSTEPS -> Empowering residents of California's affordable housing communities
<br>
- CampaignZero -> Advocating policy solutions in response to police brutality
<br>

I also currently volunteer with *WordsAlive San Diego*! If you're interested in joining me for the ride, send me a message and I'll help you get started!
