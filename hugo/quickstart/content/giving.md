These are a few of the causes that I make monthly donations to.

I'd love for you to check out their websites, read their reports, and donate to their causes if you are able to at this time.
- **Direct Relief**: providing global disaster relief and sustainable solutions
- **LifeSTEPS**: empowering residents of California's affordable housing communities
- **CampaignZero**: advocating policy solutions in response to police brutality

I also currently volunteer with **WordsAlive San Diego**! If you're interested in joining me for the ride, send me a message and I'll help you get started!
