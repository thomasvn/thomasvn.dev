Limited offensive success. Any success found was wiped out by mistakes/penalties from each position group (QB, RB, WR, OL). It was all Defense and Special-Teams today. A [historic](https://twitter.com/akashanav/status/1485289898005336064) blocked field goal and blocked punt kept the niners in the game. Not pretty, but a win is a win.
