## Container Fundamentals
The Basics
* A **container** is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.” -  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) 
	* think of containers as ~packaged up Apps~ that can be ~easily shared~ between different people, and ~easily deployed~ across a variety of environments (servers, operating systems, etc).
* “An **image** is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.” -  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) 
* A **registry** is a server that stores container images

## Container Security Fundamentals
 [The Container Threat Model](https://cloudsecdocs.com/container_security/theory/threats/docker_threat_model/) 
* Kernel Exploits
* Denial of Service Attacks
* Container Breakouts
* Poisoned Images
* Compromised Secrets

 [Container Hardening](https://cloudsecdocs.com/container_security/devops/secure_deployment/docker_focus_areas/) 
* Harden the base image (Dockerfile)
* Harden the container at runtime (`docker run`)
