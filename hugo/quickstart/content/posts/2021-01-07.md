One of my pain points while learning Terraform was figuring out how to set up an instance that I could SSH into.

While the [documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/) and [tutorials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform?utm_source=terraform_io) were robust, they seemingly couldn’t deliver a simple answer. 


## Terraform’s default EC2 instance is not SSH-ready
Setting up a basic EC2 instance will look like the following.

```
resource “aws_instance” “ssh-example” {
  ami                         = “ami-09d9c5cdcfb8fc655”
  instance_type               = “t2.micro”
  tags = {
    Name = “ssh-example”
  }
}
```

In this scenario, we are setting up the EC2 in the default VPC and the public subnet. When we provision this instance it will be given a public IP address and public DNS hostname. However, we can’t SSH into it yet.


## Setting up a Security Group for your EC2
So … you’ll need to set up an AWS security group to explicitly allow ingress SSH traffic.

```
resource "aws_security_group" "ssh-example-sg" {
  name        = "ssh-example-sg"
  description = "Allow SSH traffic"
  ingress {
    description = "SSH"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  tags = {
    Name = "ssh-example-sg"
  }
}
```

Seems obvious in hindsight. But why didn’t the default security group work? Shouldn’t that have allowed all types of ingress traffic?

Not quite. The default security group only allows all types of traffic from hosts which are already within the same security group (i.e. not your local machine).


## Providing your keys
One last step. You’ll need to associate the EC2 instance with your public SSH keys. If you need to generate a pair, you can use the handy `ssh-keygen` tool.

```
resource “aws_key_pair” “ssh-example-key” {
  key_name   = “ssh-example-key”
  public_key = file(“~/.ssh/aws-rsa.pub”)
}
```


## Finish line
Update your `aws_instance` resource to associate it with the newly defined key pair and security group.

```
resource "aws_instance" "ssh-example" {
  ami                         = "ami-09d9c5cdcfb8fc655"
  instance_type               = "t2.micro"
  key_name                    = aws_key_pair.ssh-example-key.key_name     # NEEDED FOR SSH
  vpc_security_group_ids      = [ aws_security_group.ssh-example-sg.id ]  # NEEDED FOR SSH
  tags = {
    Name = "ssh-example"
  }
}
```

Give it a shot!

```
$ terraform apply
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/aws-rsa ec2-user@<YOUR EC2 PUBLIC_DNS NAME HERE>
```
