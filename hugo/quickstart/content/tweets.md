🐣 *brief thoughts I need to write down somewhere*

> Is distraction inherently bad? I'd say no. I find that it's often what leads to inspiration.
(Feb 6, 2021)

> I think that we’re at our best when we’re inspired. We look at the world with more wonder, excitement, and hope. It’s a great state to be in and I try to make the most of those moments whenever I can.

> I think if you can master the fundamentals and the core of the tech, you can build an immunity to the surrounding trends and tools that come and go.
(Jan 15, 2021)

> Favorite place to be? The local bookstore.

> An essay requires a creativity in expressing ideas - often times just using plain language. I think code is the same. The language itself is not the hard part. Learning how to express your ideas with code is.
