üê£ *brief thoughts I need to write down somewhere*

> 49ers trade up to #3 and give away two future 1st round picks. Mixed feelings of excitement and anxiety. Don‚Äôt like putting all my chips on a single bet. Super bowl in the next 5 years or bust.
<br>(Mar 26, 2021)<br>

> The struggle when you‚Äôre trying to power nap to rest your mind, but your heart is hopped up on caffeine
<br>(Mar 21, 2021)<br>

> It‚Äôs cool and all to read about the benefits of good sleep and the consequences of poor sleep. But nothing beats the fact that poor sleep makes me feel like a zombie. And going through life as a zombie is no fun.
<br>(Feb 26, 2021)<br>

> It doesn‚Äôt seem wise to introduce a fast producer within a slow machine. Unless the producer has the freedom to change the way the machine works altogether, they will always be constrained by the bottleneck.
<br>(Feb 22, 2021)<br>

> I don‚Äôt think distraction is inherently bad. I find it‚Äôs often what leads to inspiration
<br>(Feb 6, 2021)<br>

> Feeling ‚Äúinspired‚Äù = looking at the world with more wonder, excitement, and hope. It‚Äôs a great state to be in and I try to make the most of those moments whenever I can.
<br>(Jan 31, 2021)<br>

> I think if you can master the fundamentals and the core of the tech, you can build an immunity to the surrounding trends and tools that come and go.
<br>(Jan 15, 2021)<br>

> Worst experience. Visiting a product or organization‚Äôs website and not being able to understand what the hell they do. Just meaningless jargon.
<br>(Jan 6, 2021)<br>

> Favorite place to be? The local bookstore.
<br>(Dec 12, 2020)<br>

> An essay requires a creativity in expressing ideas - often times just using plain language. I think code is the same. The language itself is not the hard part. Learning how to express your ideas with code is.
<br>(Dec 10, 2020)<br>

> highly experienced != highly talented
