🐣 *brief thoughts I need to write down somewhere*

> So … I’ve read and reread the book “Why We Sleep”. Understanding both the benefits and the harms of sleep is great. But honestly the only motivation I need is the fact that good sleep brings energy and vibrance to my day. Without that life becomes so bleak! (Feb 26, 2021)

> It doesn’t seem wise to introduce a fast producer within a slow machine. Unless the producer has the freedom to change the way the machine works altogether, they will always be constrained by the bottleneck. (Feb 22, 2021)

> Is distraction inherently bad? I'd say no. I find that it's often what leads to inspiration.
(Feb 6, 2021)

> I think that we’re at our best when we’re inspired. We look at the world with more wonder, excitement, and hope. It’s a great state to be in and I try to make the most of those moments whenever I can.

> I think if you can master the fundamentals and the core of the tech, you can build an immunity to the surrounding trends and tools that come and go.
(Jan 15, 2021)

> Favorite place to be? The local bookstore.

> An essay requires a creativity in expressing ideas - often times just using plain language. I think code is the same. The language itself is not the hard part. Learning how to express your ideas with code is.
