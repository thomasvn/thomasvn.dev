# Thomas Nguyen

## 👨🏻‍💻 Engineer, 📍 San Diego

Hey! Glad to have you here. I mostly spend my time thinking, building, reading, and writing. And I'm continuously trying to do a little more good each day.

Current interests:

- container security
- kubernetes security
- 49ers football
- intro to philosophy
- surfing
- listening to albums from start to finish
- bourbon whiskey

## Giving

These are a few of the causes that I make monthly donations to. I'd love for you to check out their websites, read their reports, and donate to their causes!

- [Direct Relief](https://www.directrelief.org/): providing global disaster relief and sustainable solutions
- [LifeSTEPS](https://lifestepsusa.org/): empowering residents of California's affordable housing communities
- [WordsAlive San Diego](https://www.wordsalive.org/): inspiring students to identify as learners and readers
- [Feeding San Diego](https://feedingsandiego.org/): connecting people facing hunger with nutritious meals

## Projects

- 🔒 [Container Harden](https://github.com/thomasvn/container-harden): A container hardening exercise. Secure configurations informed by previous container scanning and exploitation.
- 👀 [Container Scan](https://github.com/thomasvn/container-scan): Playing around with different container scanning tools and container pentesting toolkits.
- 🛑 [Terraform Pause](https://github.com/thomasvn/tf-pause): A small Makefile example to "pause" all Terraform-deployed AWS resources
- 👨🏻‍💻 [thomasvn.dev](https://github.com/thomasvn/thomasvn.dev): A space to share my work and my thoughts. Initially built using the React.js framework. Later stripped down to basic HTML/CSS for reduced complexity. Now in Hugo for simple static-site generation of Markdown content.
- ⛳️ [CTF Writeups](https://github.com/thomasvn/CTF-Writeups): I don't play CTFs often, but I'll document my problem solving when I do.
- 💭 [Thinking-Functionally](https://github.com/thomasvn/Thinking-Functionally): An attempt to begin understanding functional programming philosophy. (pure functions, removal of side effects, higher order functions)
- 🧬 [Bioinformatics (Finding Hidden Messages in DNA)](https://github.com/thomasvn/Bioinformatics): Merging my partner's background in biology with my background in computer science to learn something new together. All code challenges solved using R.
- *Thesis: Towards Automated Clarity Analysis for Privacy Policies*: I explored the factors which affect the clarity of privacy policies and proposed an automated approach to rationalizing and improving the clarity of a policy.
- *DNS Spoof Attack Simulation*: Set up a software defined network (SDN) containing a DNS server and two webservers. Then I set up an attacker machine to intercept DNS requests and respond with spoofed DNS requests to direct the victim towards a malicious web server. Tech stack: mininet, dnsmasq, scapy.
- *The Shrew Attack*: A reimplementation of Kuzmanovic's 2003 paper "Low-Rate TCP-Targeted Denial of Service Attacks". Targets the TCP implementation's retransmission time-out mechanism. Floods the router with traffic at optimal timing (right as the router is nearing the end of its time-out).
- *Proactive controllers used against SYN floods*
- *Base implementation of stateful firewall*
- *Dafny verification language*
- *Build It Break It*
