## Initial Reactions

The Packer's recipe for bullying the Niners:

- take the defensive line out of the equation (quick screens, runs, double-teams)
- target the "unseasoned" secondary (rookies, old vets, third-strings); Rodgers kept targeting Davante Adams on back-shoulder receptions; Niners had no answer until 4th quarter
- a surprisingly good job getting pressure on Jimmy with only 4 rushers
- defense stuffed the run and blocked the backside on RPOs

The Niners shortcomings:

- offense had agonizingly slow start in first half (possession GB=19:02, SF=10:58); few first downs until late in 2nd quarter
- little success in the run-game; Sermon & Juszczyk run up the gut with limited success; not patient enough to find gaps?; not enough speed to win laterally in outside zone
- defensive pass interference calls were deadly (3 penalties for 81 yards)
- defensive line were good but not great; I expected more pressure, even though GB was intent on getting the ball out quick

Some positives for the Niners:

- once the 49ers found an offensive spark, one big-play fed into the next (e.g. big runs cause teams to cheat forward, so run the reverse to gash them); long and hard-fought drives led to touchdowns
- Jimmy Garropolo receives a B-; not upset with many of his decisions, but his execution led to turnovers; poor ball placement on ~40% of throws
- some excellent displays of versatility from offensive players; Kittle in pass pro taking on edge defenders; Juszcyzk lining up in the slot running great slant routes; trent williams pulling and lead blocking
