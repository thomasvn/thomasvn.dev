## The story

I just got an email recently about my upcoming VPN subscription renewal.
Being that I wasn't ecstatic with my previous year of service, I was on the lookout for an alternative.

While researching, I had remembered that I've been wanting to set up and configure a Pi-hole for my local network!
Then I realized... would a Pi-hole on my local network even be effective if all my traffic were directed to a single destination (my VPN service provider)?
ChatGPT provided some good insight here ;)

I wasn't encouraged by ChatGPT's response, but after continued research I found this [great tutorial by Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/tutorials/pihole-vpn/) on how to configure both a Pihole and PiVPN on the same server.
Configuring them *both* on the same server allows me to tunnel my traffic through the PiVPN, and configure PiVPN to leverage Pi-hole's DNS resolution.

In my opinion, some of the primary benefits for setting up your own ad-blocking + VPN server are:
- granular control over which hostnames to block/allow
- greater control of your network traffic data (obfuscated from your local network and ISP) 
- automation to teardown & setup a new server (~30min)

## Install
