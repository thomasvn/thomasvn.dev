Not all work is created equal.
Some tasks drive greater value than others.
Some tasks bring greater joy than others.
In my work life, I've distilled all the different work I do into 4 categories:

**1. Proactive work.**
Building lasting solutions to problems.
A solution that addresses this instance of the problem, and future instances of the problem.
Examples include feature development, automation scripts, & writing tests.
And in some cases, can also include documentation, goal-setting, & strategizing.

**2. Toil.**
Manually solving problems which frequently occur.
This type of work can often feel like a "grind", when consuming much of your time & energy.
Examples include manual server upgrades, manual data migrations, manual data entry, or responding to frequently asked questions.

**3. Unplanned work.**
A task you receive which must be completed within the next ~48hrs.
Examples include a customer request, a bug, or a production incident.

**4. Meetings.**
No explanation needed here.

For me, the goal is to maximize time spent on proactive work, and minimize time spent on non-proactive work.
Keep in mind that there will always exist some toil, unplanned work, & meetings which are valuable.
But generally speaking, the goal is to solve the non-proactive work through proactive solutions (e.g. automation, communication standards).
