🛡 [**Container Harden**](https://github.com/thomasvn/container-harden): A container hardening exercise. Secure configurations informed by previous container scanning and exploitation.

👀 [**Container Scan**](https://github.com/thomasvn/container-scan): Playing around with different container scanning tools and container pentesting toolkits.

🛑 [**Terraform Pause**](https://github.com/thomasvn/tf-pause): A small Makefile example to "pause" all Terraform-deployed AWS resources

👨🏻‍💻 [**thomasvn.dev**](https://github.com/thomasvn/thomasvn.dev): A space to share my work and my thoughts. Initially built using the React.js framework. Later stripped down to basic HTML/CSS for reduced complexity. Now in Hugo for simple static-site generation of Markdown content.

⛳️ [**CTF Writeups**](https://github.com/thomasvn/CTF-Writeups): I don't play CTFs often, but I'll document my problem solving when I do.

💭 [**Thinking-Functionally**](https://github.com/thomasvn/Thinking-Functionally): An attempt to begin understanding functional programming philosophy. (pure functions, removal of side effects, higher order functions)

🧬 [**Bioinformatics (Finding Hidden Messages in DNA)**](https://github.com/thomasvn/Bioinformatics): Merging my partner's background in biology with my background in computer science to learn something new together. All code challenges solved using R.

**Thesis: Towards Automated Clarity Analysis for Privacy Policies**: I explored the factors which affect the clarity of privacy policies and proposed an automated approach to rationalizing and improving the clarity of a policy.

**DNS Spoof Attack Simulation**: Set up a software defined network (SDN) containing a DNS server and two webservers. Then I set up an attacker machine to intercept DNS requests and respond with spoofed DNS requests to direct the victim towards a malicious web server. Tech stack: mininet, dnsmasq, scapy.

**The Shrew Attack**: A reimplementation of Kuzmanovic's 2003 paper "Low-Rate TCP-Targeted Denial of Service Attacks". Targets the TCP implementation's retransmission time-out mechanism. Floods the router with traffic at optimal timing (right as the router is nearing the end of its time-out).

**Proactive controllers used against SYN floods**

**Base implementation of stateful firewall**

**Dafny verification language**
